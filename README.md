# Tdmb Movies Investigation


Conclusions
From my findings I have been able to show that :
1. There has been an exponential increase in the prduction of movies over the years.
2. Drama genre produced most movies in 2015 with a total of 260 movies.
3. Movies with lower Revenue has lower movie Rating and this translate that the popuarity of a movie does not determine the total income of a movie.
4. The Duration of movies does not determine their Ratings
LIMITATIONS:
The cast column could have been cleaned by removing the '|' charater but it was not needed for our findings.
The Movies-Revenue VS Movies-Popularity could have been plotted with a bigger scale to enlarge the visualization.
